Warriors by Imagine Dragons- This song was made for the world championships of the video game called League of Legends. I have devoted a substantial amount of time and money towards that game. I feel that this song emulates the feelings of all those who play the game as much as I have trying to get better every day.

Johnny, I hardly knew Ya by Dropkick Murphys- starts off the list. I started listening to the Dropkick Murphy’s while I was in a military Highschool. This was a song I began to listen to constantly during that time, which I felt depicted war very well. I figured that that life wasn’t for me as I went on in that school and ended up transferring.

The spicy McHaggis Jig by Dropkick Murphys – This song is just a great song to listen to while going on a pub crawl which is probably why it’s a drinking song. Listening to this song gives me a sense of joy and community that I wish I could experience with people everywhere. 

B.Y.O.B. by System of a Down- This song I heard from Guitar Hero on Xbox 360 when I was in highschool. I liked this song quite a bit and it ended up leading me to listen to more alternative metal as I went through highschool. This leads to the next song that I like by them as well. 

Chop Suey! By System of a Down- I really had taken a liking to this song after I discovered it. This was because I was raised in a religious family and hearing this kind of felt like I was rebelling against them. It kind of marked the point where I felt I had some sort of freedom in my life. 

Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd- Speaking about freedom, I was never one to stay in one place when it came to music. I really do not have a favorite genre and listened to whatever was given to me. My friend told me to get Guitar Hero 2 and to try out this song. Not only was it good but it was hard. I took it as a challenge. Unfortunately, I failed that challenge.

Handlebars by Flobots- I found this song as I was wandering throughout youtube. Normally I wouldn’t listen to a song much as they did not really catch my attention. This one did though. I liked how it told a story through the music it played. It let me use my imagination to see a different world than the one we see everyday. Not to mention I love the trumpet solo they have in here.

Three Little Birds by Bob Marley & The Wailers- I like this song because it emulates how I feel about life today. Don’t worry about the future because it’s going to turn out fine. Do what you can today and accept whatever happens because of your actions tomorrow because in the end it’ll be fine.  

Pokemon by Jason Paige- I watched pokemon daily as a child. It was by far my favorite show when I was growing up. This theme song has been so ingrained into my head that I can’t help but like it. The music is great, the lyrics are fun, and the nostalgia runs high.

Sorairo Days by Shoko Nakagawa- This song is only a cover but it comes from my favorite animated show ever, Tengen Toppa Gurren lagann. That show pushed me over the edge and made anime a great hobby of mine. This is why I am the Vice President and ex-president of the Japanese Film and Animation Society here at the school.

Saludos Saludos by Aguinaldo Isabalino- This music emulates my ethnicity very well. I am Puerto Rican and we have a tradition where we go around on Christmas to friend’s houses playing music late in the night. As we visit each house we take one of the members of the household and add them to our little troupe and travel onto the next house. This is called a Parranda. This song is the main song that is played in front of people’s houses. I love this because it fosters community with your friends and neighbors.
